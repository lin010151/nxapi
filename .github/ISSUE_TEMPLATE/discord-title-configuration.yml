        > Discord now allows requesting to show the details or state field under the user's name, which allows showing the full title name instead of "Nintendo Switch"/"Nintendo Switch 2" for all titles, although this doesn't allow fully customising the activity name. It is no longer necessary add title configuration that only sets a custom Discord application.

        Include all related title IDs and their names, for example any demos or other versions (such as regional variants and online/prerelease demos), from all Nintendo eShop regions, even if they are not available for download.

        If the title/s already has/have custom Discord configuration, you don't need to include all title IDs - just one to identify it. If the title hasn't been released yet and doesn't have a title ID, add a note in the other information section below, and the expected release date and links to Nintendo websites/Nintendo eShop NSUIDs.

        Application title IDs are 16 hexadecimal digits, and should start with `0100` (Nintendo Switch) or `0400` (Nintendo Switch 2) and end with `0000`, `2000`, `4000`, `6000`, `8000`, `a000`, `c000` or `e000`.
